# RNG-Bot
A Discord bot that gives users to engage in games with an RNG aspect. (I don't want to discredit the skill involved in these games.)

### Ideal Games to Eventually Add 
* Coin Flip Predictor
* Rock, Paper, Scissors
* Hangman
* Roulette
* Blackjack

Users / players will gamble an amount to play against the bot. Each user will be given a starting currency.

### RNG Non-Games
* Fortune Cookie (provides good and nonsensical proverbs?)
* 8ball Answerer (brutally honest, mildly vulgar?)
* RNG Chooser (Insert a given number of users and bot will choose between the choices at random)

### More Miscellaneous Features (Less Likely in the Near Future)
* Play music (maybe from Youtube? Possibly Spotify?)
* Assign roles?
* Kick people
