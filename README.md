# RNG-Bot
A Discord bot that gives users to engage in games with an RNG aspect. (I don't want to discredit the skill involved in these games.)

### Ideal Games to Eventually Add 
* Coinflip
* Rock, Paper, Scissors
* Hangman
* Roulette
* Blackjack

Users / players will gamble an amount to play against the bot. Each user will be given a starting currency.

### More Miscellaneous Features (Less Likely in the Near Future)
* Play music (a la Youtube? Possibly Spotify)
* Assign roles?
