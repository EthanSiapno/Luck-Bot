# RNG-Bot
A Discord bot that gives users to engage in games with an RNG aspect. (I don't want to discredit the skill involved in these games.)

# Currently Implemented

### Non-Games
* 8Ball
  * Ask a Yes/No question and get greeted with support ... or sarcasm.
* Fortune Cookie
  * Receive advice from a sometimes funny, sometimes wise fortune cookie.
* RNG Chooser
  * Provide a number of choices and the bot will pick one of the choices at random. Separate the choices with a space between each word.

# Mid-Implementation:

### Non-Games
* Number Guessing Game (Higher or Lower)
  * Need to figure out how to have the bot active until the game is finished
* Lottery Number Picker 
  * Pennsylvania Powerball
  * Mega Millions

# Unimplemented:

### Games 
* Coin Flip Predictor
* Rock, Paper, Scissors
* Hangman
* Roulette
* Blackjack

### Non-Games
* Russian Roulette
* Dice Rolls / Number Picker within range / Coin Flip (non-gambling)
* Jokes
* Reminder

### More Miscellaneous Features (Less Likely in the Near Future)
* Users / players will gamble an amount to play against the bot. Each user will be given a starting currency.
* Play music (maybe from Youtube? Possibly Spotify?)
* Assign roles?
* Kick people

Note to self: Don't forget to run "source (filename).env" before running the bot.py in order to make sure the token is selected.
